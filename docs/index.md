# Welcome to My Dev Docs!

I created this site to document various things I've learned over the years. Sometimes, it's hard to scour through all the documentation to find the one thing you need when you need it the most. This site is my attempt to make that easier for myself and others.

### Why the name?

```
aaramsesounga (आराम से सोऊंगा) - I'll sleep peacefully
```

I know how we all developers, do mess up our sleep schedules, while trying to figure out that one thing that's been bugging us.

It's always "Bas yeh fix karlu, fir mai **aaram se sounga** (I'll fix this and then I'll sleep peacefully)".
Thus we end up staying awake till 4 AM, and then we have college at 8 AM the next day. Fixing that one thing takes hours, had I documented it, I could have just looked it up and fixed it in minutes.

I hope this site helps you get back to your sleep schedule faster.

### Why the dog?

I love dogs, and I love the internet. So, I thought why not combine the two.

### Can I contribute?

Sure yeah! Just make a PR [here](https://github.com/shouryade/dev-docs/pulls) and I'll review it. If it's good, I'll merge it. If it's not, I'll let you know what you can do to make it better.
