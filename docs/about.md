I am primarily backend developer with a penchant for building efficient and scalable systems. I have a strong background in programming languages such as `Python` and `JavaScript`, and I enjoy solving complex problems. |

Aside from development, I have a keen interest in reading and exploring new technologies and frameworks.
I have recently started diving deep in Machine Learning and Data Science, and I am currently learning Natural Language Processing techniques.

I also do love listening to music, my current favourites being Pink Floyd and Guns N Roses.

In my free time, I enjoy reading novels, making paintings, and reading about numismatics and its history.
